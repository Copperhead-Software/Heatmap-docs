implementation
===================================

The implementation of the API is quite simple:

make one request to this address:
``http://api.coppperheadsoftware.co:5000/heatmap/?UID=<your UID here>&activity=<whatever the activity name is>``

here's your react code:
https://github.com/Copperhead-Software/Heatmap-docs/blob/main/implementation/examples/react.js

here's your python code:
https://github.com/Copperhead-Software/Heatmap-docs/blob/main/implementation/examples/python.py

Pretty self explanitory right? You can use any language you want, just make a request to the API with the UID and the activity name. see the usage API guide for more information.
